            Hi thereðŸ‘‹ My name is Mithat. I graduated from the Department of
            Business Administration in 2017 and have since gained experience
            across a range of industries. However, I discovered that I wasn't
            fulfilled in those roles. When the pandemic hit, I turned to
            software development and found a new passion. Since then, I've been
            dedicating my time to self-improvement and continuous learning. <br/><br/> I
            completed a Frontend Developer course at Bilge Adam, where I honed
            my skills in Javascript and React.js. Currently, I'm not only
            working as an active Frontend Developer but also pursuing a degree
            in Computer Engineering. With a drive to innovate and create, I am
            excited to explore the possibilities that lie ahead in the world of
            software development.<br/><br/> Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn as I
            am always eager to collaborate and learn from like-minded
            professionals. Let's shape the future of technology together!
          </p>

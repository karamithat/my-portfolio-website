            Hi thereðŸ‘‹ My name is Mithat. I graduated from the department of
            business administration in 2017. I have experience in various
            industries. But I realized that I am not happy with the work I do. I
            started working on software during the pandemic period. I started to
            feel good. Since that day, I spend my time improving myself and
            learning. I graduated a frontend developer course with Angular and
            React js at Bilge Adam.
